# Description
When playing with collisions enabled and trying to cloak, the tiniest bump, scrape, or bruise from a bad pilot decloaks you.
It's almost impossible to cloak when you're in the middle of a fight as you'd pretty much instantly get decloaked by an AI ship scratching your paint unless you first get clear of the fight. 

This mod fixes that issue by restoring the behaviour you see while playing with collisions disabled.
If you fly a ship with integrated ramming weapons, you will still decloak and ambush as usual when you smash into something.

# Installing
Simply grab the .dll from the release and stick it into steam\steamapps\common\Star Valor\BepInEx\plugins folder. 
You'll have to install BepInEx first if you haven't already though.
